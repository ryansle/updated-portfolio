            Primarily, my skillsets are in builing web applications - specifically the front-ends. 
            I'm hoping in time to pivot more towards full-stack web development so that I can build
            out every aspect of my applications from start to finish. Here are some of my favorite
            technologies to use at the moment:

      <Text fontSize="xl" mb={5}>
        I had a brief stint in mobile development a while ago. While it wasn't my favorite thing
        in the world, I feel that the year I spent doing gave me enough experience to include
        it on this list with the following technologies:

      <SkillTable

        skills={mobiledev} 
      />

      <Heading size="lg" mb={5}>Other Programming Languages</Heading>
      <Text fontSize="xl" mb={5}>
        Of course, I've dabbled with other programming languages as well, 
        both in and out of the classroom. Here they are:
      </Text>
      <SkillTable 
        caption="Languages I don't use super regularly, but am confident in picking back up when needed."

      <Heading size="lg" mb={5}>Other Skills</Heading>
      <Text fontSize="xl" mb={5}>
        Some of the other random things I've picked up in college, 
        or and during my stints in industry, include:
      </Text>
      <SkillTable 
        caption="Frameworks and technologies I've dabbled in that I feel I know how to use."
