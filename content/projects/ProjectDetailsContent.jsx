        If you ever saw my old portfolio, you might remember how... clunky it felt. 
        So, once I realized how easy Chakra UI was to work with, and how nice it looked, 
        I knew I couldn't try to advertise my skills as a front-end developer while 
        sticking with my original portfolio website that I built while still trying to 
        figure out how to use React.js.
      </Text>
      <Text fontSize={["md", null, "xl"]} mb={5}>
        There were a number of things wrong with it. For starters, I was literally 
        building the website at the time to learn how to use React.js. For a time, 
        I had no idea what I was doing. Whatever code I could steal off of StackOverflow 
        to make things functional, whether I understood it or not, I did. The codebase 
        probably violates the DRY principle of software development more times than you 
        can count, and I didn't know how to use functions like <Code>arrays.map()</Code>, so there were 
        all sorts of wonky things inside.

        For starters: better practices within React.js! I've learned how to build 
        more function-specific components, and some better ways to handle written content like this.
        It's not perfect yet, but it's a big step forward from my previous implementation. More
        specifically, how to use a new component library, Chakra UI, which I've since fallen in love with.
        I also got to gain some additional practice using Next.js and some of its core functions like
        server-side rendering, routing, and more.

        The original portfolio I made was the first thing I ever built when I started

        After all, that was the whole reason I even built it in the first place: to
        learn something new while also showcasing my current skillsets to start
        searching for new work opportunities. Up to this point in my college career, I
        hadn't really "focused" on any aspect of software development yet: I had tried
        my hands at developing VR games, general scripting in Python, and done mobile
        development in Swift. But none of that had really piqued my interest. On top
        of that, I had recently lost a planned internship where I was going to learn
        fundamental web development concepts, and just wanted to spend some time over
        the summer learning <i>something.</i>

        and <Link href="https://www.peytontanzillo.com" color="teal.500">Peyton Tanzillo</Link>.
        Not only were they able to answer my questions when I would get stuck, but they
        were able to point me to different online resources to aid in my learning of the framework.
        Probably the resource I used the most in getting started was{" "}
        <Link href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" color="teal.500">freecodecamp.org</Link>. They
        provided me the baseline information I needed to understand how to <i>use</i> React.js,

        Our team at Nelnet, the Campus Key team, utilizes Material Design patterns on all of our web applications.
        They're not that fun to synthesize on your own - so when I joined, I pitched that we move away from using

        The implementation of the Material-UI framework solved a plethora problems our team faced immediately on Day

        While working at Raven, I was primarily responsible for

        Excel spreadsheet to find pertinent data for upcoming meetings, formatting it
        into a readable report, and then using these handmade reports in their meetings.

        Thus, by far the most important lesson I learned over the summer was, in the words of my

        ask for help, and the steps I would take prior, I was forced to do more searching on
        my own, leading me to (thankfully) become a better problem solver.

            Buckle needed a way to provide a unified and appropriate social brand that protected
            the brand's image. Because they have so many stores across the US (449 and counting), 
            it proved to be impractical to field and service each stores' one-off requests for
            approving social media content.

          <Text fontSize={["md", null, "xl"]} mb={5}>
            In order to solve this, Buckle wanted a mobile application that allowed their
            marketing department to provide approved social media posts for their teammates
            to use nationwide.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={["md", null, "xl"]} mb={5}>
            Our team's solution enlisted a content management system, Drupal, to house the 
            marketing department's approved content. From there, individual pieces of
            content were assigned start and end dates for the content to run through, and
            valid posts were pulled down to our iOS application using a REST API and showcased
            to a user in a feed visually similar to Instagram.

          <Text fontSize={["md", null, "xl"]} mb={10}>
            Marketing employees around the country could then share these approved social
            media posts and promotions to a variety of different channels, including Facebook,
            Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn with ease.

        The University of Nebraska-Lincoln, normally, offers a technical elective
        every spring entitled "Exploring Virtual Reality" that pairs computer science
        and software engineering students with emerging arts students to create
        virtual reality games.
      </Text>
      <Text fontSize={["md", null, "xl"]} mb={5}>
        The course follows a sandbox format where they basically give you a quick
        introduction to developing games with C#, Unity, and SteamVR, and then they
        set you loose to break into teams and spend the semester developing your
        very own virtual reality experience. Our team decided to spend the semester
        building out a VR Space Exploration game in which you explore alien worlds
        and play a variety of minigames.

      <Heading size="lg" mb={5}>What did I learn?</Heading>
      <Text fontSize={["md", null, "xl"]} mb={10}>
        Through this course I learned the basics of modern game development, 
        specifically with regards to virtual reality. It turns out that developing 
        virtual reality games is not nearly as complicated as it seems out to be, 
        thanks to existing technologies and frameworks such as Unity and SteamVR. 
        I also got to work side-by-side with emerging arts students to understand 
        the underlying effort that goes into rendering digital assets, and again 
        sharpen my skills working in a collaborative environment.
